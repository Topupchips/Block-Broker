A frontend website for our hackathon app that aims to allow freelancers to leverage smart contracts to be paid by buinesses.

## Getting things running
To get the frontend running you will need to:
1. Open the terminal and navigate to MLH-Web3-Hackathon/mlh-w3-hackathon-frontend folder
2. Use the command `npm install` to install all of the node modules on your machine. You will need npm installed and updated to the latest version.

ALso insure that you are in the correct directory.
3. Use the command `npm run dev` or `sudo npm run dev`
